# odin-recursion

Run `pnpx tsx --watch recursion.ts`

## Description

The [tenth Odin project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-recursion) is a simple recursion exercise to discover data structures and algorithms (DSA)

## Features

Just JavaScript (TypeScript)

## Challenges

The merge Sort recursive algorithm was complex for me because it needed to understand the merge logic first (which constructs a new array by sorting the elements from two)
